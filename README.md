## Documentation 

### `/src` Folder Structure

- `/components` concerns any and all components that are not wired into the App's state. They may hold internal state of their own (ie, a form). Don't place any components in there wired into an overarching app/global state.
   - `/atoms`: Atoms are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.
   - `/molecules`: Molecules are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components.
   - `/organisms`: Organisms are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.
- `/templates` Templates place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.
- `/state`: React Context(s)
- `/containers`: Components that are wired to the app state
- `/utils`: Any and all utility functions.

### File Naming Convention

We will be using `kebab-case` for all filenames. This is to ensure that this repo is cross-compatible between Windows, Linux, and OSX. 

### JS(X) Naming Convention

`PascalCase` for all React Components.

`camelCase` for all other Javascript

### Types or Interfaces for PropTypes? 

Use types. Here's an example: 

```typescript 

type ComponentProps = {
    foo: string,
    bar: number
};

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({foo, bar}) => <div>{foo}{bar}</div>;

```

### Should I use `any` in type?

As a rule of thumb: no. We will turn away most PRs using an `any`. If you feel like you need to use `any`, here's what you can do: 
1. Ask in discord if there is a way to solve around the `any`
2. Leave a comment describing why `any` was used before submitting your PR.

### Atomic Design Methodology

Splitting up all **stateless** react components into the relevant folder related to the UI's concerns.

## To Do 
======

Follow the project plan: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBWPG63CScyJOjs8T86K0Hzc8az5__72A2jkJANI8Z4/edit

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to gather info on local clinics distributing Vaccines, primarily focusing on 55+.

**Internally:** We are creating a way to view vaccine availability at clinics across Canada. 

**Externally:** Communicating the vaccine availability slots at clinics via twitter. 

Big idea: twitter followers see slots available 

### Overarching Product-related Goals: 

1. Display vaccine appointment availability summary (including link to book)
2. Group Regional Availabilities
3. Ask user for relevant information
    a. Phase 1: 55+
        1. Clearly displays:
            a. appointment locations
            b. dates (if applicable)
            c. separates providers with confirmed appointments from unconfirmed appointments
        2. Focus appointments at:
            a. Pharmacies
            b. Hotspot Clinics
            c. Hotspot popups
            d. Popups/Clinics for some phase 1 & phase 2 communities (ie, MHC indigenous clinic)
        3. Information collected:
            a. Age
            b. Postal Code
            c. Phase 1 & 2 community checkboxes
    b. Phase 2: Everyone
        1. Focus on appointments at
            a. Phase 1 targets
            b. Hospitals & Mass vaccination clinics
            c. Any alternative, human-inputted source
        2. Information collected:
            a. Phase 1 Information
            b. Health conditions
            c. Occupation
            d. Anything else relevant to future rollout eligibility
4. A clear UI. No muss, no fuss.
